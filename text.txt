These three Git commands are used to **track, save, and upload your changes to GitHub**. Here’s what each one does:  

### **1. `git add .`**  
✅ **Stages all modified and new files** for commit.  
- It tells Git to track all changes in the current project directory.  

### **2. `git commit -m "Your update message"`**  
✅ **Saves the changes** to your local Git repository.  
- The `-m "Your update message"` adds a meaningful message describing what you changed.  

### **3. `git push origin LUFFY`**  
✅ **Uploads (pushes) the committed changes** to GitHub.  
- `origin` refers to your remote repository on GitHub.  
- `LUFFY` is the branch where you are pushing the changes.

### **In Simple Terms:**  
- **`git add .`** → Select all changes  
- **`git commit -m "Updated feature"`** → Save changes locally  
- **`git push origin LUFFY`** → Upload changes to GitHub  

💡 **Use these commands every time you update your project!** 🚀

### **Starting Work on a Collaborative Project:**

When you start working on a collaborative project, follow these steps:

### **1. `git pull origin LUFFY`**  
✅ **Fetches and merges changes** from the remote repository to your local repository.  
- Ensures your local repository is up-to-date with the latest changes from the LUFFY branch.

### **2. `git checkout -b your-branch-name`**  
✅ **Creates and switches to a new branch** for your work.  
- Helps in keeping your changes isolated from the LUFFY branch until they are ready to be merged.

### **3. `git add .`**  
✅ **Stages all modified and new files** for commit.  
- It tells Git to track all changes in the current project directory.

### **4. `git commit -m "Your update message"`**  
✅ **Saves the changes** to your local Git repository.  
- The `-m "Your update message"` adds a meaningful message describing what you changed.

### **5. `git push origin your-branch-name`**  
✅ **Uploads (pushes) the committed changes** to GitHub.  
- `origin` refers to your remote repository on GitHub.  
- `your-branch-name` is the branch where you are pushing the changes.

### **6. Create a Pull Request on GitHub**  
✅ **Propose your changes** to be merged into the LUFFY branch.  
- Allows other collaborators to review and approve your changes before merging.

💡 **Use these commands every time you start working on a collaborative project!** 🚀

### **Handling Non-Fast-Forward Errors:**

If you encounter a non-fast-forward error when pushing your changes, follow these steps:

### **1. `git pull origin LUFFY`**  
✅ **Fetches and merges changes** from the remote repository to your local repository.  
- Ensures your local repository is up-to-date with the latest changes from the LUFFY branch.

### **2. Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise**  
- If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them. Edit the conflicting files to resolve the conflicts, then stage the resolved files using `git add`.

### **3. `git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"`**  
✅ **Commits the merge conflict resolutions** to your local Git repository.  
- Adds a meaningful message describing that you resolved merge conflicts.

### **4. `git push origin LUFFY`**  
✅ **Uploads (pushes) the committed changes** to GitHub.  
- `origin` refers to your remote repository on GitHub.  
- `LUFFY` is the branch where you are pushing the changes.

### **Handling Unrelated Histories Error:**

If you encounter an unrelated histories error when pulling changes, follow these steps:

### **1. `git pull origin LUFFY --allow-unrelated-histories`**  
✅ **Fetches and merges changes** from the remote repository to your local repository, allowing unrelated histories.  
- Ensures your local repository is up-to-date with the latest changes from the LUFFY branch.

### **2. Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise**  
- If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them. Edit the conflicting files to resolve the conflicts, then stage the resolved files using `git add`.

### **3. `git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"`**  
✅ **Commits the merge conflict resolutions** to your local Git repository.  
- Adds a meaningful message describing that you resolved merge conflicts.

### **4. `git push origin LUFFY`**
