These three Git commands are used to **track, save, and upload your changes to GitHub**. Here’s what each one does:  

BEFORE STARTING NEW WORK :
1. git checkout main

2. git pull origin main

3. git checkout -b features/your-branch-name



### **1. `git add .`**  
✅ **Stages all modified and new files** for commit.  
- It tells Git to track all changes in the current project directory.  

### **2. `git commit -m "Your update message"`**  
✅ **Saves the changes** to your local Git repository.  
- The `-m "Your update message"` adds a meaningful message describing what you changed.  

### **3. `git push origin main`**  
✅ **Uploads (pushes) the committed changes** to GitHub.  
- `origin` refers to your remote repository on GitHub.  
- `LUFFY` is the branch where you are pushing the changes.
